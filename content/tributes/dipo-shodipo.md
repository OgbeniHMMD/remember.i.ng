Born Oladipo Eniola Sodipo, Dipo Shodipo (also known as, Pope) was from Abeokuta, Ogun state, Nigeria.
He was Nigeria's first one-man band, and he played the highlife in a unique way. He was a father, lecturer, singer, musician, instrumentalist until his death in year 2000. Rumour had it that uncle Dipo died of a lung disease.

Dipo Shodipo, Sola Makinde, Tunde Fasesin, Niyi Kuforiji and few others (including ladies) made up the K12 Voice in their prime years. They usually meet at Odo-Ona, Ibadan for their practice.

Though, there is very little about uncle Dipo on the internet, Lanre Makinde, one of pope's associates and songwriter created a [memorial facebook page][1] in his memory in the year 2013, i.e, 13 years after his death.

> “...we collaborated musically whilst he was with us. I wrote songs on his albums including Je k'owo wo 'le mi, T'ola ba de, and Tera m'ose to mention a few
> ... I also play highlife music, to sustain the magic we shared and continue where he left. May his soul continue to rest in perfect peace.”
> – Lanre Makinde, [2013]

_Amoran (Advice)_ and _Full blown_ were (among) his albums before his demise.
