> _“Tunji Oyelana’s voice has to be heard to be directly savoured. It is mellifluous. It seems to flow from ancient sources. It recalls a time from very long ago. It is the voice of a poet, and that is perhaps why each of his songs is a poem. It is this quality that has given my plays their splendid assets, and made Oyelana one of my principal collaborators…Tunji Oyelana taught me the usefulness of music in the theatre…he became my preferred musician, the one I gave my working scripts to spontaneously fill in the music for me. That is why his music signatures are all over my work…”_ — Professor Femi Osofisan, 1989
